#### WHY Generative AI is an important although ML/AI has been around for a while, why it matters now
Generative AI Models’ accuracy and effectiveness have a hit a tipping point\
•	Powerful enough to enable use cases not feasible even a year ago
•	Economical enough for use even by non-technical business users
Generative AI models and tooling are readily available
•	Many models are open source and customizable
•	Require powerful GPUs, but are available in the cloud
